<b>(a)</b>:An illustration of redundancy-aware repulsion (RAR). Disagreement on anomalies is amplified between different learnersâ€™ feature spaces, while normal input converges to similar reconstructions guided by reconstruction training. <b>(b)</b>: A t-SNE plot of feature spaces from three learners on the anomaly. Feature spaces are pushed away by RAR during training. <b>(c)</b>: An illustration of dual-space uncertainty (DSU) in 1D regression with two learners. Utilizing output space uncertainty fails to differentiate the anomaly at the upper point. In comparison, DSU utilizes the disagreement on $\nabla_{X}{f}$ to detect such anomalies.

In the training stage, the redundancy-aware repulsion (RAR) module amplifies the diversity of different models with both isotropic and scaling invariance. In the inference stage, the dual-space uncertainty is calculated, utilizing both $f(X)$ in the output space and $\nabla_{X}\mathcal{L}$ in the input space.

## Data Preparation

Organize the Med-AD benchmarks manually follow the [guidance](https://github.com/caiyu6666/DDAD-ASR/tree/main/data).


## Environment

- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
- Python 3.8.16
- Cuda 11.7
```
conda create --name d2ue python=3.8.16
conda activate d2ue
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu117 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```
### Packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Train and Evaluate

All scripts are available in `scripts/`, and configuration files are in `cfgs/`.
For example, you can choose to train and evaluate the method on RSNA dataset using AE as the backbone: `./scripts/RSNA_AE.sh`


The trained models and results are available [here](https://github.com/Rubiscol/D2UE/releases/tag/publish).
